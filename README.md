# Analysing event logs from ERP systems for fraud examination: A process mining-based approach

This repository provides the pseudo-code for the SQL transformations for fraud examination with process mining.

# How to read the code?

The repository consists of 3 files: the Event\_Log\_Template, Create\_PurReq, and Change\_PO\_Items.

## Setting Event Log Template

The Event\_Log\_Template defines the columns required to define the event log. SAP specific fields are commented as such. These columns need to be altered depending on the source ERP system used.

## Mining events which create new process artefacts

Create\_PurReq demonstrates mining events which involves creation of a new artefact within the process. It looks for new entries created in the designated table for the artefact.

## Mining events which alter existing process artefacts

Change\_PO\_Items demonstrates mining event which are conditional or tracking changes to existing artefacts through entries in change history.
